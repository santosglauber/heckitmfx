Description: Computes partial and total marginal effects for two-step sample selection models (Heckit). The partial marginal effects refer to marginal effects associated with changes in the probability of selection and with changes in the conditional outcome. Total marginal effects refer to marginal effects on the unconditional outcome. There are different functions for using an outcome variable measured in level or in logarithms.
